My main research areas are household finance, real estate economics, and behavioral economics. I study how individuals and households make consumption and savings decisions, and how they utilize financial instruments such as retirement savings accounts, mortgages, and other credit products. I study how behavioral frictions impact how households utilize these products and the implications for welfare and for policy design.
